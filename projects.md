### Here you can find all projects of hate speech detection at our lab.

## General methodologies

- Word/character level features (swear words, stereotypes) 
- Semantic features (sentiment analysis, TF\-IDF) 
- Word embedding 
- Shallow learning as well as deep learning model

## In Progress

**Definition of hate speech**

- Review of literature, laws, platform ToS 
- Review of existing NLP work and datasets 
- Summarize common criteria of different area 
- Explain limitation of current work
- Explain the neccesarity of definition of hate speech
- Try to operationalize the definitions into NLP framework

**Operationalize legal documents into NLP task**

- It is a new task with great value in real-life application 
- Formulating legal conditions into NLP framework 
- Abstract different levels/components for NLP model 
- Possible problems and solutions of the task
- You can find our web-demo [here](http://134.91.18.147:8080/checker/#/input)

**Cultural difference in perception of hate speech**

- Datasets collection (in Chinese, English and Germany) 
- Dataset analysis and comparison 
- Possible solution of of detect hate speech based on culture background (not solved yet)
- You can find our dataset [here](./datasets)

## Planed

**Group detection in hate speech dataset**

- Will cooperate with another PhD student 
- Possible ideas is to use knowledge graph combined with NLP method

**COVID\-19 hate speech targeted to Chinese**

 - Will cooperate with [Yuning Ding](https://www.ltl.uni-due.de/team/yuning-ding)
 - We already have the data 
 - Research question need to be clarified/specified

## Past

**SemEval Shared Task-5**
- A [shared task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19935) aim to detect hate speech targeted to women or refugess, you can find more information in [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2007.pdf)
- We evaluated a wide range of approaches in NLP and outperforms the average score
- We also point out the potential bias in the dataset
