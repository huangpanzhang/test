We collected about 50 social media posts which are marked as hateful by legal department in Germany. This is as a beginning of the cooperation with the Prosecutor in Cologne. In Germany we have laws to define whether a qoute of text on social media is hateful or not. However, manual cencorship is very expensive and is not efficient. Inspired by the idea of [operationalize legal conditions into NLP process](2019/07/22/Incitement-to-Hatred.html), we collected real data from the legal department, in order to test our theory.
