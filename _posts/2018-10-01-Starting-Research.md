[Huangpan Zhang](https://www.ltl.uni-due.de/team/huangpan-zhang) joined our lab today as a Ph.D. Candidate. We also started ***hate speech detection on social media*** as a new research area. This research is part of the research project [UCSM](https://www.ucsm.info/). This is a big research training group at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science, University of Duisburg-Essen. This project is funded by by DFG and started on October 1, 2015.

We have conducted multiple research projects in regard to hate speech. Our research interests lie on automatization of hate speech detection and how improvement and reliability in automated detection can be achieved. To do so, we have examined definitional and linguistic challenges and assessed how gender can play a role in hate speech detection. We have explored the development of monolingual and multilingual classification systems which can be used to identify and categorize offensive language on social media. We have generated a classification system to distinguish between free speech and language constituting a criminal offense. While our research focus lies on the technicality of hate speech, our aim is to take a more holistic approach by also taking social and legal aspects into consideration.
